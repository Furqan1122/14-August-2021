          Sir Muhammad Iqbal KCSI ( محمد اقبال‎) 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938) was a South Asian Muslim writer,philosopher, and politician, <br>
          whose poetry in the Urdu language is among the most well-regarded of the twentieth century, and whose vision of a cultural and political ideal for the Muslims of British-ruled <br>
          India was to animate the impulse for Pakistan. He is commonly referred to by the honorific Allama <br>
          (from Persian: علامہ‎, romanized: ʿallāma, lit. 'very knowing, most learned').<br>
          Born and raised in Sialkot, Punjab in an ethnic Kashmiri Muslim family, Iqbal studied in Sialkot and Lahore, and thereafter in England and Germany. <br>
           In England he did his B.A. that made him eligible to practice Law as an advocate. Although he established a law practice after returning, he concentrated primarily on writing scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy, and religion. <br>
            He is best known for his poetic works, including Asrar-e-Khudi – which brought a knighthood, Rumuz-e-Bekhudi, and the Bang-e-Dara. <br>
             In Iran, where he is known as Iqbāl-e Lāhorī (Iqbal of Lahore), he is highly regarded for his Persian works. Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic civilisation across the world,<br>
              but in particular in South Asia; a series of lectures he delivered to this effect were published as The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam.<br>
               A leader in the All India Muslim League, he envisioned—in his 1930 presidential address—a separate political framework for Muslims in British-ruled India.<br>
                After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, he was named the national poet there. The anniversary of his birth (Yom-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl) on 9 November was a public holiday in Pakistan.<br>
