          <strong>By 1940</strong>, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their <u>own state</u> to avoid the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent <u>Hindu–Muslim state</u>.<br>
           <strong>In that year</strong>, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a <u>separate nation for British Indian Muslims</u>.<br>
            <strong>During the Second World War</strong>, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, <u>it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims</u>.
             <strong>Ultimately</strong>, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence,<br>
              leading all parties to agree instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. <br>
              As the <strong>first Governor-General</strong> of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan after the two states' independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps.<br>
               Jinnah <strong>died at age 71</strong> in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom.<br> He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.<br>
                <strong>According to his biographer</strong>, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.
