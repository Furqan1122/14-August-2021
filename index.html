  <h1>14 August History</h1>
  <p>14 August, is a national holiday in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign state following the end of the British Raj in 1947.
    Pakistan came into existence as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Movement">Pakistan Movement</a>, which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state in the north-western regions of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj">British India</a> via partition.The movement was led by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League">All-India Muslim League</a> under the leadership of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a>. The event was brought forth by the Indian Independence Act 1947 under which the British Raj gave independence to the Dominion of Pakistan which comprised <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan">West Pakistan</a> (present-day Pakistan) and East Pakistan ( now<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> ). In the Islamic calendar, the day of independence coincided with
    Ramadan 27, the eve of which, being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadr_Night">Laylat al-Qadr</a>, is regarded as sacred by Muslims. The main Independence Day ceremony takes place in Islamabad, where the national flag is hoisted at the
    Presidential and <a href="http://www.senate.gov.pk/en/parliament.php?id=-1&catid=4&subcatid=267&cattitle=Parliament%20House">Parliament buildings</a>. It is followed by the national anthem and live televised speeches by leaders. Usual celebratory
    events and festivities for the day include <a href="http://mofa.gov.pk/flag-hoisting-ceremony-7/">flag-raising ceremonies</a>, parades, cultural events, and the playing
    of patriotic songs. A number of award ceremonies are often held on this day, and Pakistanis hoist the national flag atop their homes or display it prominently on their vehicles and attire.</p>

  <h2>British rule</h2>
  <p>None of the territory of modern Pakistan was ruled by the British, or other European powers, until 1839, when Karachi, then a small fishing village with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken, and held as an enclave with a port and military
    base for the First Afghan War that soon followed. The rest of Sindh was taken in 1843, and in the following decades, first the East India Company, and then after the post-Sepoy Mutiny (1857‚Äì1858) direct rule of Queen Victoria of the British
    Empire, took over most of the country partly through wars, and also treaties. The main wars were that against the Baloch Talpur dynasty, ended by the Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh, the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845‚Äì1849) and the Anglo-Afghan Wars
    (1839‚Äì1919). By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire, and remained so until independence in 1947.

    Under the British, modern Pakistan was mostly divided into the Sind Division, Punjab Province, and the Baluchistan Agency. There were various princely states, of which the largest was Bahawalpur. Sindh was part of the Bombay Presidency, and there
    were many complaints over the years that it was neglected by its distant rulers in modern Mumbai, although there was usually a Commissioner based in Karachi.

    The Punjab (which included the modern Indian state) was instead technically ruled from even more distant Calcutta, as part of the Bengal Presidency, but in practice most matters were devolved to local British officials, who were often among the
    most energetic and effective in India. At first there was a "Board of Administration" led by Sir Henry Lawrence, who had previously worked as British Resident at the Lahore Durbar and also consisted of his younger brother John Lawrence and
    Charles Grenville Mansel.[105] Below the Board worked a group of acclaimed officers collectively known as Henry Lawrence's "Young Men". After the Mutiny, Sir John Lawrence became the first Governor of Punjab. The Punjab Canal Colonies were an
    ambitious and largely successful project, begun in the 1880s, to create new farmland through irrigation, to relieve population pressure elsewhere (most of the areas involved are now in Pakistan).

    The Baluchistan Agency largely consisted of princely states and tribal territories, and was governed with a light touch, although near the Afghan border Quetta was built up as a military base, in case of invasion by either the Afghans or the
    Russians. The 1935 Quetta earthquake was a major disaster. From 1876 the sensitive far north was made a "Chief Commissioner's Province". The border with Afghanistan, which remains the modern border of Pakistan, was finally fixed on the Durand
    Line in 1893.

    Railway construction began in the 1850s, and most of the network (some now discontinued) was completed by 1900. Karachi expanded enormously under British rule, followed to a lesser extent by Lahore and the other larger cities.

    Different Regions of Pakistan were conquered by East India Company as below:
    ‚Ä¢Sindh was conquered by Battle of Hyderabad and Battle of Miani in 1843.
    ‚Ä¢Punjab and eastern Khyber pakhtunkhwa were conquered during Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849.

    Regions conquered by British Raj are as below:
    ‚Ä¢Southern Balochistan came under control by Treaty of Kalat in 1876.
    ‚Ä¢Western Balochistan was conquered by British empire in Second Anglo-Afghan War through Treaty of Gandamak, in 1879.</p>

  <h2>Early period of Pakistan Movement</h2>
  <p>In 1885, the Indian National Congress was founded as a forum, which later became a party, to promote a nationalist cause.[106] Although the Congress attempted to include the Muslim community in the struggle for independence from the British rule
    ‚Äì and some Muslims were very active in the Congress ‚Äì the majority of Muslim leaders, including the influential Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, did not trust the party.

    A turning point came in 1900, when the British administration in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh acceded to Hindu demands and made Hindi, the version of the Hindustani language written in the Devanagari script, the official language. The
    proselytisation conducted in the region by the activists of a new Hindu reformist movement also stirred Muslim's concerns about their faith. Eventually, the Muslims feared that the Hindu majority would seek to suppress the rights of Muslims in
    the region following the departure of the British.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Muslim League</h2>
  <p>The All-India Muslim League was founded by Shaiiq-e-Mustafa in 30 December 1906, in the aftermath of division of Bengal, on the sidelines of the annual All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in Shahbagh, Dhaka East Bengal.[107] The meeting
    was attended by three thousand delegates and presided over by Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk. It addressed the issue of safeguarding interests of Muslims and finalised a programme. A resolution, moved by Nawab Salimullah and seconded by Hakim Ajmal Khan.
    Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk (conservative), declared:

    The Musalmans are only a fifth in number as compared with the total population of the country, and it is manifest that if at any remote period the British government ceases to exist in India, then the rule of India would pass into the hands of
    that community which is nearly four times as large as ourselves ... our life, our property, our honour, and our faith will all be in great danger, when even now that a powerful British administration is protecting its subjects, we the Musalmans
    have to face most serious difficulties in safe-guarding our interests from the grasping hands of our neighbors.[108]

    The constitution and principles of the League were contained in the Green Book, written by Maulana Mohammad Ali. Its goals at this stage did not include establishing an independent Muslim state, but rather concentrated on protecting Muslim
    liberties and rights, promoting understanding between the Muslim community and other Indians, educating the Muslim and Indian community at large on the actions of the government, and discouraging violence. However, several factors over the next
    thirty years, including sectarian violence, led to a re-evaluation of the League's aims.[109][110] Among those Muslims in the Congress who did not initially join the League was Jinnah, a prominent statesman and barrister in Bombay. This was
    because the first article of the League's platform was "To promote among the Mussalmans (Muslims) of India, feelings of loyalty to the British Government". The League remained loyal to the British administration for five years until the British
    decided to reverse the partition of Bengal. The Muslim League saw this British decision as partial to Hindus. In 1907, a vocal group of Hindu hard-liners within the Indian National Congress movement separated from it and started to pursue a
    pro-Hindu movement openly. This group was spearheaded by the famous triumvirate of Lal-Bal-Pal ‚Äì Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal of Punjab, Bombay and Bengal provinces respectively. Their influence spread rapidly among
    other like minded Hindus ‚Äì they called it Hindu nationalism ‚Äì and it became a cause of serious concern for Muslims. However, Jinnah did not join the League until 1913, when the party changed its platform to one of Indian independence, as a
    reaction against the British decision to reverse the 1905 Partition of Bengal, which the League regarded it as a betrayal of the Bengali Muslims.[112] After vociferous protests of the Hindu population and violence engineered by secret groups,
    such as Anushilan Samiti and its offshoot Jugantar of Aurobindo and his brother etc., the British had decided to reunite Bengal again. Till this stage, Jinnah believed in Mutual co-operation to achieve an independent, united 'India', although he
    argued that Muslims should be guaranteed one-third of the seats in any Indian Parliament.
    The League gradually became the leading representative body of Indian Muslims. Jinnah became its president in 1916, and negotiated the Lucknow Pact with the Congress leader, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, by which Congress conceded the principle of
    separate electorates and weighted representation for the Muslim community.[113] However, Jinnah broke with the Congress in 1920 when the Congress leader, Mohandas Gandhi, launched a law violating Non-Cooperation Movement against the British,
    which a temperamentally law-abiding barrister Jinnah disapproved of. Jinnah also became convinced that the Congress would renounce its support for separate electorates for Muslims, which indeed it did in 1928. In 1927, the British proposed a
    constitution for India as recommended by the Simon Commission, but they failed to reconcile all parties. The British then turned the matter over to the League and the Congress, and in 1928 an All-Parties Congress was convened in Delhi. The
    attempt failed, but two more conferences were held, and at the Bombay conference in May, it was agreed that a small committee should work on the constitution. The prominent Congress leader Motilal Nehru headed the committee, which included two
    Muslims, Syed Ali Imam and Shoaib Quereshi; Motilal's son, Pt Jawaharlal Nehru, was its secretary. The League, however, rejected the committee's report, the so-called Nehru Report, arguing that its proposals gave too little representation (one
    quarter) to Muslims ‚Äì the League had demanded at least one-third representation in the legislature. Jinnah announced a "parting of the ways" after reading the report, and relations between the Congress and the League began to sour.

      <td> Important leaders in the Muslim League highlighted that Pakistan would be a 'New Medina', in other words the second Islamic state established after Muhammad's creation of an Islamic state in Medina. Pakistan was popularly envisaged as an
        Islamic utopia, a successor to the defunct Turkish Caliphate and a leader and protector of the entire Islamic world. Islamic scholars debated over whether it was possible for the proposed Pakistan to truly become an Islamic state.

        While the Congress' top leadership had been in prison following the 1942 Quit India Movement, there was intense debate among Indian Muslims over the creation of a separate homeland. The majority of Barelvis and Barelvi ulema supported the
        creation of Pakistan and pirs and Sunni ulema were mobilized by the Muslim League to demonstrate that India's Muslim masses wanted a separate country. The Barelvis believed that any co-operation with Hindus would be counter productive.[137]
        On the other hand, most Deobandis, who were led by Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani, were opposed to the creation of Pakistan and the two-nation theory. According to them Muslims and Hindus could be one nation and Muslims were only a nation of
        themselves in the religious sense and not in the territorial sense.[138][139][140] At the same time some Deobandi ulema such as Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi, Mufti Muhammad Shafi and Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani were supportive of the Muslim
        League's demand to create a separate Pakistan.

        Muslims who were living in provinces where they were demographically a minority, such as the United Provinces where the Muslim League enjoyed popular support, were assured by Jinnah that they could remain in India, migrate to Pakistan or
        continue living in India but as Pakistani citizens. The Muslim League had also proposed the hostage population theory. According to this theory the safety of India's Muslim minority would be ensured by turning the Hindu minority in the
        proposed Pakistan into a 'hostage' population who would be visited by retributive violence if Muslims in India were harmed.
